        I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice \n
        And it don\'t count for much \n
        But I\'m not letting go \n
        I believe there\'s still much to believe in \n \n

        So lift your eyes if you feel you can \n
        Reach for a star and I\'ll show you a plan \n
        I figured it out \n
        What I needed was someone to show me \n \n

        You know you can\'t fool me \n
        I\'ve been loving you too long \n
        It started so easy \n
        You want to carry on (carry on) \n \n

        Lost in love and I don\'t know much \n
        Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? \n
        But I\'m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted \n \n

        So lift your eyes if you feel you can (feel you can) \n
        Reach for a star and I\'ll show you a plan (show you a plan) \n
        I figured it out \n
        What I needed was someone to show me (oh, oh-oh) \n \n

        You know you can\'t fool me \n
        I\'ve been loving you too long (I\'ve been loving you too long) \n
        It started so easy \n
        You want to carry on (carry on) \n \n

        Lost in love and I don\'t know much \n
        Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? \n
        But I\'m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted \n \n

        You know you can\'t fool me \n
        I\'ve been loving you too long \n
        It started so easy \n
        You want to carry on (on, carry on) \n \n

        Lost in love and I don\'t know much \n
        Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? \n
        But I\'m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted \n \n

        Now I\'m lost (lost in love and I don\'t know much) \n
        Lost in love (was thinking aloud and fell out of touch) \n
        Lost in love (but I\'m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted) \n
        Lost in love \n
        Now I\'m lost (lost in love and I don\'t know much) \n
        I\'m lost in love (was thinking aloud and fell out of touch) \n
        I\'m lost in love (but I\'m back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted) \n
        Lost in love \n
